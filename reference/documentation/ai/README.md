# AI Documentation Domain

This directory is reserved for AI-facing documentation standards.

## Boundary

- AI behavior and context artifacts are governed separately from human-facing docs.
- Human documentation policy and templates are defined in `../human/`.

## Current State

This directory is intentionally minimal until AI-specific standards are finalized.
