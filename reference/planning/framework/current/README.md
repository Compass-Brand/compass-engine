# Current Phase

`current/` contains the active BMAD roadmap phase only.

When a phase is complete:
1. Move `current/` contents to `previous/<roadmap-phase>-<completion-date>/`.
2. Extract reusable process or quality lessons into `lessons/<roadmap-phase>-<completion-date>/`.
3. Start the next phase in `current/`.
