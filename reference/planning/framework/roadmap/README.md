# Project Roadmap

`roadmap/` is for cross-phase planning artifacts.

- `brainstorming/`: macro-level idea exploration.
- `research/`: macro-level discovery and validation.
- `product-brief/`: project-level product framing.
- `archive/`: completed or superseded roadmap artifacts.
- `roadmap.md`: canonical roadmap state.
