# Reference Materials

`reference/` is intentionally minimal.

Rules:
- Do not store legacy or archived implementation dumps here.
- Keep this directory only for concise, current reference artifacts that support active development.
- If a file is stale or superseded, delete it instead of archiving it in-repo.
