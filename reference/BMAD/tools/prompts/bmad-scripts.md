# Purpose

To help with context bloat when using the BMAD method, scripts can be used in some parts to eliminate AI usage.

# Custom Modules Path

**Windows**
..\..\modules\custom\
**Linux**
../../modules/custom/


# Instructions

## Step 1
**Module Menu**
1. Scan the custom modules folder to see all available modules.
2. Give the user a menu of all available modules with the final option being all

**Example**
```
1. BMM
2. Core
3. All
```

## Step 2
**Action**
- For all modules selected, go through each entire workflow and sequentially analyze each step to see if any part can be replaced with scripts that take many variables and return structured outputs deterministically instead.
